## Description
Spartan Gallery is a simple but robust online marketplace allowing artists of all forms to connect and share their art with fans and potential clients.

At the core of the Spartan Gallery are the artists themselves, as on the Gallery they will able to share a portfolio of their works, pieces that they have available for purchase, information on commissions and potential showings of their work. Be that a painters, sculptors, musicans or writers all will be able to become an artist and share their work in the Gallery.

Meanwhile users of the Spartan Gallery will be able to browse their favorited artists works, receive notifications about any new works or performances and also search for new artists to follow.

Lastly we have our Sysadmins who will monitor the experience of the platform managing artists and adding more of them, also to make sure they are selling their art appropriately and not scamming others. The admins will also gather feedback from our users and apply them to the platform so things may run smoothly for them and us.
